## Introduction
Improved version of the SALVO Wabbajack. Handles installing the 2k version of SALVO. You can also install the 1k version, but you will need to run the SALVO scripts yourself if you do.

## Requirements
- Completed the [Before You Begin](https://salamand3r.fail/salvo/before-you-begin) section of SALVO.
- [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/)
- Latest Wabbajack file for SALVO downloaded from [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/92376).

## Key Terminology
- **Working directory**: The `SALVO` folder on the root of whatever drive you're downloading the SALVO files to.

> Example: `C:\SALVO`

## Installation
1. Create a folder for Wabbajack outside of any default Windows folders.
> Example: `C:\Modding\Wabbajack`

2. Place the downloaded Wabbajack.exe in this folder and run it.
3. Select `Browse Modlists`, and click the `Install from disk` button at the top right of Wabbajack.
4. Select the `SALVO.wabbajack` file you downloaded.
6. In `Installation Location`, select a folder that is not:
  * The Steam folder,
  * Any default Windows folders,
  * The Game folder,
  * The folder where you put Wabbajack.exe.

> Example: `C:\SALVOMO2`

> [!tip]
In `Downloads Location` you can set it to SALVO's `working directory` if you want to install the 1k version instead.

7. Click `Install` to begin the installation.
8. Accept the Nexus Mods API request.
9. If you are not a Premium user you will need to manually click download for each mod.
10. Once complete, Wabbajack will show a green `Installation Complete` screen.
> [!note]
> The installation will probably fail on the downloads for `ghouls.7z` and `securitronHD.7z`. You can simply manually download the files and place them in your `Downloads Location`. It seems to be an issue with Wabbajack and certain Google Drive files that are within size limits for a virus scan (`bsp_textures2.zip` seems to download fine and it's the only one that shows a warning the user that it's too large to be scanned for viruses).

## Post Installation
1. In your main MO2 instance, click the ![mo2 folders menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zpok3/salvo-wabbajack-improved/main/images/folders%20menu.webp) button and select `Open Mods folder`.
2. In your `Installation Location`, open the `mods` folder and move the `SALVO` folder to the `mods` folder you opened in step 1.
3. Back in MO2 press `F5` and enable the mod `SALVO` which should appear at the bottom of the left pane of MO2.
4. You are now ready to follow the [Install and LOD](https://salamand3r.fail/salvo/install-and-lod) section of SALVO.

## 1k Install Steps
1. In your `Installation Location`, open the `__SALVO` folder and copy **everything** to your `working directory`.
2. You are now ready to follow the [Running the Things](https://salamand3r.fail/salvo/running-the-things) section of SALVO.
